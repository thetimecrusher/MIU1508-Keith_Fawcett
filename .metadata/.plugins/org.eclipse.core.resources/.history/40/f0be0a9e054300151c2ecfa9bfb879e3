		{"Title" : "Nexus 6",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $499.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5.1",
		"ScreenSize" : "Screen size: 5.96-inch",

		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 13MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 2MP",
		"Description": "Nexus 6 has a nearly bezel-free display, so the finger-stretching dimensions actually manage to be not too far off the size of the iPhone 6 Plus, which includes Apple's physical home button. The size of the phone is comparable, yet the screen size happens to be much bigger."},
		
		{"Title" : "Sony Xperia Z3",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $629.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5.0.2",

		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 20.7MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 2.2MP",
		"Description": "Skip the on-contract Sony Xperia Z3v and forthcoming Sony Xperia Z4v, which are only available through Verizon, and opt for the infinitely better Sony Xperia Z3. Its the true upgrade to Sony Xperia Z2 that's already outdated by the Z3's aluminium frame. Plastic is out and metal-and-glass design are in."},

		{"Title" : "iPhone 6 Plus",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $199.99",
		"OS" : "OS: iOS 8.4",

		"Battery" : "Battery: 2,915mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 8MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 1.2MP",
		"Description": "Its 5.5-inch Full HD display makes it almost as multimedia-friendly as the iPad mini 3. All of a sudden, there's even less reason to check out that tablet. Simply put, it has the best specs within the iPhone lineup: a killer camera with optical image stabilization, a crisp 1080p screen and a bigger battery."},

		{"Title" : "Samsung Galaxy Note 4",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $299.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5.0.1",

		"Battery" : "Battery: removable 3,220mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 16MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 3.7MP",
		"Description": "Note 4's camera exhibits punchy colors, and for the most part works flawlessly. In fact, some scenes look more dramatic than real life due to Samsung's image processing. Under the Gorilla Glass 3 and Super AMOLED is a solid Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB of RAM and a user-replaceable 3220mAh Fast Charging battery."},
		
		{"Title" : "Sony Xperia Z3 Compact",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $519.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5",

		"Battery" : "Battery: 2,600mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 20.7MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 2.2MP",
		"Description": "Less powerful with a lower-res screen than its bigger brother, the Z3 Compact still uses most of the high-end specs, fuses them with things like Remote Play and the 20.7MP camera, and does it all at a low, no-contract cost for a phone of this power."},
		
		{"Title" : "Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge",

		"Battery" : "Battery: 2,560mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 16MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 5MP",
		"Description": "Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge has all the power and features of the table-topping S6, but does it with a little extra flair thanks to the curved edges on each side. They're pretty much aesthetics, as they don't add a huge amount of functionality, but if you're going on looks alone, the S6 Edge has them in spades."},
		
		{"Title" : "HTC One M9",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $199.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5",
		"ScreenSize" : "Screen size: 5-inch",
		"Resolution" : "Resolution: 1080p",
		"Memory" : "Memory: 3GB",
		"Storage" : "Storage: 32GB",
		"Battery" : "Battery: 2,840mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 20.7MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 4MP",
		"Description": "None of the old favorites are missing, so BoomSound enhancement still really turbocharges the audio and the Sense overlay remains one of our favorites, thanks to being sophisticated and really powerful. The camera has been boosted to 20.7MP, although it doesn't have the impressive snapping power of some of the other phones on the market, and the design language still means this is one of our favorites phones to stick in the pocket."},
		
		{"Title" : "LG G4",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $199.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5.1",

		"Battery" : "Battery: removable 3,000mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 16MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 8MP",
		"Description": "LG has tried to focus on what everyone actually wants out of a smartphone, a great looking design, color rich display and the great camera for photos - but it doesn't quite deliver as impressively as we'd hoped. Its large, expansive screen is one of the best on the market, the 16MP laser auto-focus camera takes some cracking shots and the rear buttons are easier to hit on a handset this size."},
		
		{"Title" : "iPhone 6",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $199.99",
		"OS" : "OS: iOS 8.3",
		"ScreenSize" : "Screen size: 4.7-inch",
		"Resolution" : "Resolution: 750p",
		"Memory" : "Memory: 1GB",
		"Storage" : "Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB",
		"Battery" : "Battery: 1,810mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 8MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 1.2MP",
		"Description": "iOS 8 is so easy to use that you can operate an iPhone with one hand. That's why we like the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 the best among Apple devices. It's almost the best phone on the list. Sure, it doesn't excel in any given part of the smartphone recipe, but it just works, promoting simplicity over complicated menus."},
		
		{"Title" : "Samsung Galaxy S6",
		"Image" : "",
		"Price" : "Price: $199.99",
		"OS" : "OS: Android 5.0.2",

		"Resolution" : "Resolution: 1440p",
		"Memory" : "Memory: 3GB",

		"Battery" : "Battery: 2,550mAh",
		"RearCam" : "Rear camera: 16MP",
		"FrontCam" : "Front camera: 5MP",
		"Description": "The camera is superb, the audio and video quality brilliant and the QHD display crammed into the 5.1-inch screen is the sharpest on the market - although it does suck down the battery rather a lot. The longer lasting, though ugly, Samsung Galaxy S6 Active is a fine alternative that's waterproof."},
